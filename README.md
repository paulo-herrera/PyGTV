Background
===========

GIS systems store vector layer information as shape (than contain information about geometry) 
and associated files (that are simple database-like objects that store attributes). 

The pyshp library parses .shp  and associated files (.dbf and .shx) and provides a simple API
to walk through the shapes that are part of the geometry and their associated information.
